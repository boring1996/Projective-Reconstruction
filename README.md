# Projective-Reconstruction
From several images of a scene and the coordinates of corresponding points identified in the different images, it is possible to construct a three-dimensional point-cloud model of the scene and compute the camera locations. From uncalibrated images the model can be reconstructed up to an unknown projective transformation, which can be upgraded to a Euclidean model by adding or computing calibration information.
